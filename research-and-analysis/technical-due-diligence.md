# Comprehensive Technical Due Diligence (OSINT) Investigation Template

## Objective
Conduct an extensive and exhaustive open-source intelligence (OSINT) investigation to perform technical due diligence on the company specified below. Your goal is to **gather, analyze, and synthesize all publicly available information** to create a cohesive, structured report. This report should meticulously assess the company's technology stack, engineering practices, infrastructure, security posture, intellectual property, technical debt, scalability, and the talent of its technical teams. The primary aim is to identify technical strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) relevant to a potential investment, acquisition, partnership, or critical vendor relationship.

## Research Guidelines
1.  **Exhaustive Search:** Employ a wide array of search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, specialized engines), utilizing advanced search operators (site:, filetype:, related:, inurl:, etc.).
2.  **Platform Exploration:** Systematically explore company websites (including sitemaps, `robots.txt`, historical versions via Wayback Machine), public financial filings (if applicable), social media (LinkedIn, X/Twitter, Facebook, Instagram), professional networks, developer forums (Stack Overflow, Reddit), code repositories (GitHub, GitLab), technical blogs, news archives, academic repositories, patent/trademark databases, WHOIS records, DNS records, SSL certificate details, and cloud service provider documentation/marketplaces.
3.  **Tool Utilization:** Consider using OSINT tools for domain analysis, subdomain enumeration, technology fingerprinting (e.g., Wappalyzer, BuiltWith), code analysis (for public repos), and social media intelligence.
4.  **Cross-Verification:** Meticulously cross-reference information from multiple sources to validate accuracy and build a comprehensive, reliable picture.
5.  **Timeline Awareness:** Pay close attention to the dates of information to assess current relevance and track evolution over time.
6.  **Factual Prioritization:** Clearly distinguish between **verifiable facts**, **strong indicators**, **informed inferences**, and **speculation**. Prioritize evidence-backed findings.
7.  **Competitor Benchmarking:** Where possible and relevant, compare findings against known competitors to provide context.
