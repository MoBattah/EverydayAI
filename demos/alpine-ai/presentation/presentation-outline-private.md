## **Part 1: The Philosophy (The "Why")**

*(Goal: Establish immediate resonance with fellow engineers by framing the problem as engineering toil vs. creative work. Present a philosophy of work that every engineer will covet.)*

### **A. Introduction: Speaking Peer-to-Peer**

* **My Background:** Recently VP, DevOps Engineering at Actabl/Alpine Investors. Since leaving 1.5 months ago, I've advised on >$10M in transactions and am currently helping founders in AI agents, cybersecurity, and deep tech.

* **Portfolio Context for Speaking Notes:**
  * **ProtectAI** (→ Palo Alto Networks): AI security, protecting ML models from attacks
  * **Skydio**: Autonomous drones revolutionizing power line inspection, bringing down electricity costs
  * **Dreadnode**: Red teaming against AI systems, offensive LLM security for government and enterprise
  * **Resourcely** (→ Cursor): Infrastructure as code platform
  * **Kodiak Robotics**: Autonomous trucking already operating in Permian Basin, moving sand for fracking operations
  * **Additional notable portfolio**: Sublime Security (trusted by Netflix, Spotify), Nucleus Security (American Airlines, Mastercard), SpecterOps (market-leading cybersecurity), and many others

* **AI as Deflationary Force Context**: Skydio and Kodiak are perfect examples of AI dramatically reducing costs in critical infrastructure. Skydio is making power line inspection vastly cheaper, potentially reducing electricity costs. Kodiak's autonomous trucks in the Permian Basin are already reducing transportation costs for oil operations, potentially affecting gas and oil prices through efficiency gains.

* **Refined Narrative:** "AI isn't about replacing us; it's about automating the mundane so we can focus on the monumental. I'm not here to show you theoretical futures—I'm showing you systems I use daily to close real deals and help portfolio companies scale."

### **B. Core Principle: Augmentation, Not Abdication**

* **Core Message:** This is not about blindly trusting AI or outsourcing our thinking. It's about a fundamental shift in our role, moving from a "doer" to an "architect." It’s a new, more leveraged form of engineering leadership where we define the problem, design the solution, and act as the ultimate verifiers of quality.  
* **The Key Axiom:** "If a task can be fully automated to a satisfactory degree, our job is to find the next, more valuable task up the chain. We use AI to augment our judgment, not replace it. The goal is to operate at a higher level of abstraction."

## **Part 2: The Practitioner's Stack (The "How")**

*(Goal: Showcase your personal toolkit not as a random collection of apps, but as a deliberately architected stack for achieving maximum leverage.)*

### **A. My Stack for Leverage: A 4-Stage Context Engineering Pipeline**

*(Core Message: Context is gold. Without good context engineering, prompt engineering is irrelevant. But here's the deeper truth—it's not just prompt engineering. All AI outputs are completely irrelevant without good context. Context poisoning is the real threat. This isn't a random collection of tools; it's a deliberate, four-stage pipeline for manufacturing perfect, context-rich prompts. High-quality output requires high-quality input, and this is the system I use to create it.)*

**Key Quotes to Reference:**
- *"Context is everything, yet context is what's missing."* - This paradox captures the challenge perfectly. Context determines everything about AI quality, yet it's consistently the weakest link in most people's AI workflows.
- *"The whole world is an intelligence game."* - A friend's insight that became crystal clear once I understood context engineering. In business, in technology, in relationships—it's all about having better information and context than the other party. AI amplifies this reality exponentially.

**Speaking Note:** "These quotes didn't make sense to me until I got deep into context engineering. Now I realize that context engineering isn't just a technical skill—it's the fundamental skill for the AI age. Bad context doesn't just give you bad outputs; it poisons your entire decision-making process."

* **Stage 1: Context Inception (Wispr Flow)**  
  * **Pitch:** "The entire process starts with high-bandwidth thought capture. Keyboards are a bottleneck. Wispr Flow is my primary compute interface. Wispr allows you to talk/dictate/speak into any textbox whether on your computer or phone. Already, this is a significant speed advancement, People will naturally output more text if the input mechanism is speech instead of typing on a keyboard. Now, where this goes from a handy daily tool to the base of context engineering is that you can use Wispr Flow for turning unstructured verbal brainstorming into structured, AI-ready text. Your thoughts, you just speak, verbalize in real-time, transcribed become a digital asset—the raw material for the entire AI workflow."  
  * **Application:** "This is foundational. I use it for everything from drafting emails to capturing real-time thoughts while walking through a house, or more importantly, talking through a complex systems design and architecture problem at work. The output is a repository of authentic, high-fidelity text that becomes our initial, unvarnished context. Now, you might ask: Hey Mo, you're telling me I speak and this technology will listen to me and transcribe my thoughts, and maybe I'll even use AI to help structure those thoughts? Okay, I get you. Well Mo, where do I store all these documents? Do I store them in Google Docs or Word? Let's talk about context storage, and management. "
  * **Volume:** ~100K words/month of voice dictation
  * **Key Insight:** Your thoughts become digital assets that can be processed and leveraged by AI

* **Stage 2: Context Storage & Management (Git Markdown Repository as Second Brain)**  
  * **Pitch:** "This is where we ensure deterministic, reliable context instead of relying on probabilistic MCP server calls. I download all emails with individual partners, clients, or business contacts into folders, then use Claude Code or Gemini CLI to flatten all the emails into markdown files that get stored in my Git repository."  
  * **Why GitHub over Notion:** "I used to put everything in Notion, but the Notion MCP server is too finicky. Whenever you're using an MCP server, you're relying on probabilistic outcomes. Instead of asking AI to always review the latest emails with someone through MCP tool calls—which you sometimes don't know if it messes up or not—I just have a file of all the emails. That way it's deterministic, the data is there, and all AI has to do is help me with the task I'm asking, which is usually a question about the context."
  * **Application:** Email histories become searchable, reliable context files that AI can always access
  * **Technical Details:** Download email folders → AI flattens to markdown → commit to GitHub repo
  * **Context Examples:** Project goals, business insights, client data, personal career strategy, email histories, call transcripts

* **Stage 3: Context Refinement & Enrichment (Agentic Partners)**  
  * **Pitch:** "Raw text and stored context are just starting points. The next step is to refine and structure it. I use agentic partners like Claude Code and Gemini CLI as infinitely patient junior developers. They take the raw context from Wispr plus the stored context files, organize it, enrich it with research, and build it into more robust, analytical documents that are ready for complex queries."  
  * **Application:** "For that house tour, the agent transforms my rambling notes into a structured pros/cons list and researches neighborhood comps and school ratings. For a coding problem, it converts my verbal stream-of-consciousness into a preliminary bug report, complete with code snippets and a list of potential root causes. For business relationships, it can cross-reference my notes with the complete email history to provide strategic insights."

* **Stage 4: Context Assembly & Orchestration (Prompt Tower)**  
  * **Pitch:** "This is the final and most powerful step where we achieve insurmountable leverage. Prompt Tower is the ultimate context assembler. It takes all the disparate pieces of context we've created and refined—the Wispr transcripts, the agent-generated reports, the flattened email files, relevant code files, API documentation, meeting notes—and allows me to orchestrate the perfect, holistic prompt."  
  * **Application:** "For strategic call preparation—my most common use case—I select all past call transcripts, the flattened file of our email history, and a natural-language 'status' file that captures the nuances of the relationship that a tool like Monday.com can't. My prompt is then simple: 'Based on all this, what are my next steps? And critically, what potential dissatisfactions do I need to surface and address?' For the house purchase, I can select the refined reports for three properties, add a context file with my financial data, and another with my family's requirements. For a software engineering problem, I can select the bug report, the relevant codebase files, and transcripts from team calls discussing the issue. Prompt Tower assembles all of this into one massive, perfectly-formed prompt that gives the AI a complete, 360-degree view of the problem, enabling it to provide a deeply insightful and immediately useful solution. Typically, these prompts end up in Gemini because of their 1 million token context. My submissions are typically north of 100,000 tokens."
  * **Technical Features:** VSCode extension, file selection interface, custom prompt prefixes/suffixes, one-click clipboard copy
  * **Economic Advantage:** Gemini's flat consumer fee allows unlimited iteration and prompt optimization

### **B. The Demos: Primitives for Building Systems**

*(Goal: Present your demos as case studies in applying engineering principles to automate toil.)*

* **Demo 1: The Modular Resume System (A Case Study in "Documentation as Code")**  
  * **The Pitch:** "We all hate updating documentation because it's manual, repetitive, and prone to error. I applied a software engineering mindset to a classic business problem: the resume. This is a system built on modular, version-controlled components—our single source of truth—which are then assembled by templates and automated with build scripts. The result is publication-quality, ATS-optimized, and role-specific outputs generated on the fly."  
  * **The Connection:** "This is a powerful principle. Now, imagine applying it to your team's technical documentation, API specs, or customer-facing reports. We can stop manually writing docs and start generating them from the source, ensuring they are always accurate and up-to-date. This is how we solve the documentation problem for good."  
  * *(Showcase the resume-system/ demo. Run the build script.)*  
* **Demo 2: AI-Assisted Technical Analysis (Automating the "Last Mile")**  
  * **The Pitch:** "This demonstrates the output of such a system, automating the final, painful step of presentation. It combines AI-driven content generation with the typographic precision of LaTeX. Notice the programmatically generated TikZ diagrams—no more struggling with Visio or Lucidchart. This entire professional-grade report was rendered from simple Markdown files with a single command: quarto render."  
  * **The Connection:** "This is how we automate the 'last mile' of technical communication. It ensures that our hard work is presented with the professionalism it deserves, without hours of manual formatting. It allows us to focus on the substance of our analysis, knowing the system will handle the world-class presentation."  
  * *(Showcase the report-generation/ demo. Display the .qmd file next to the final PDF.)*  
* **Demo 3: The AI-Powered Feedback Loop (Systematizing Self-Improvement)**  
  * **The Pitch:** "As engineers, we're great at getting feedback on our code, but often terrible at getting objective feedback on our communication. I treat this as another engineering problem. By recording and transcribing my professional calls (with consent), I create a dataset of my own performance. I then use AI to analyze it, asking critical questions: 'Where are my communication gaps?', 'How could I have handled this negotiation better?', 'What is the sentiment of this call?' This has been one of the most high-leverage ways to improve myself. I will often ask AI for book recommendations—whether it is a new domain I'm getting into (like a certain sector of private equity), a specific communication skill that I'm interested in developing, or an interpersonal skill."  
  * **The Connection:** "This system provides a data-driven, objective feedback loop for the soft skills that determine career velocity. It helped me identify a tendency to be overly accommodative in negotiations and gave me the confidence to advocate for myself more effectively. It's a way to systematically debug our own professional performance, addressing the imposter syndrome that holds so many of us back."  
* **Demo 4: The AI Vocabulary Coach (Extending Expertise Infinitely)**  
  * **The Pitch:** "We often hit a plateau in our professional language. This system, inspired by legendary grammarians like Norman Lewis and Tom Heehler, acts as a personalized vocabulary coach. I feed it my call transcripts, and it analyzes my language to identify words just at the edge of my current vernacular, making my communication more precise and impactful. The prompts for this are open-sourced in my GitHub."  
  * **The Connection:** "This demonstrates a profound principle: AI can take a finite resource—like the knowledge in a beloved book or the expertise of a mentor who is no longer with us—and extend its value infinitely. It transforms a static resource into a dynamic, personalized learning engine that continuously refines our most critical tool: our language. This is how we systematize not just our work, but our own growth."  
* **Demo 5: The Automated Networking Strategist (Building an AI-Powered CRM)**  
  * **The Pitch:** "Networking is often reactive and based on memory. This system makes it proactive and strategic. When I get new connections on LinkedIn, I feed them to an agent. The agent researches each person and cross-references them against my personal context files—my career goals, business objectives, and areas of interest."  
  * **The Connection:** "The AI acts as a strategic filter. It reconciles the public data about a person with my private goals to determine if they are a relevant connection. If they are, it automatically adds them to my personal CRM—a simple Markdown database—with notes on why they're relevant. This transforms a passive activity into an automated, high-leverage networking strategy, ensuring I'm building a valuable network with almost zero manual effort."

## **Part 3: The Paradigm Shift (The "What If")**

*(Goal: Connect your system directly to the daily work of the audience and present a new, more powerful way of operating.)*

### **A. The New Paradigm: From Writing Code to Directing Code Generation**

* **Core Message:** This is a fundamental shift in our role and where we provide value. The bottleneck is no longer typing speed or syntax knowledge; it's the quality of our thinking, our ability to design robust systems, and our rigor in verifying the output. The senior engineer's primary role becomes that of an architect and the final checkpoint for quality and correctness.  
* **The Anthropic PR is Your Proof Point:**  
  * **Pitch:** "This isn't a toy or a theoretical exercise. This is how high-performance teams are already operating. Anthropic successfully merged a 22,000-line, Claude-generated PR into their production RL systems. How? By shifting their entire review process away from painstaking line-by-line code review to a higher-level focus on behavioral verification and system-level testing."  
  * *(Show the "Vibe Coding" slides from index.qmd)*

### **B. Principles for the New Paradigm**

* **1\. Change the Abstraction:** Treat the AI like a hyper-productive team you manage. Your job is to write the spec, not the code. Focus on acceptance tests, stress tests, and verifiable system behaviors.  
* **2\. Constrain the Blast Radius:** Start with "leaf nodes"—isolated features, UI components, or scripts with no dependencies. Keep the core, foundational architecture human-owned and rigorously reviewed.  
* **3\. Act as the Model's PM:** Spend 15-20 minutes creating a comprehensive brief. Your leverage comes from the quality of your direction—providing repository maps, context, constraints, and clear success criteria.  
* **4\. Build for Verifiability:** Design for black-box testing. If you can't verify the output with a deterministic input/output contract and robust testing, you can't safely use the generated code.

## **Conclusion & Discussion**

### **A. The Cohesive System**

* **Closing Statement:** "These aren't just isolated tricks or clever hacks. They are components of a cohesive system for professional practice, built on engineering principles. This is how I operate. It’s a system designed to maximize the time we spend on interesting, high-impact problems and mercilessly eliminate the time we spend on everything else."  
* **Subtle Positioning:** This subtly positions you as the expert they should turn to when they want to implement these ideas and build their own systems for leverage.

### **B. Answering Our Opening Questions**

* **SDLC Change:** Engineers become architects and product managers for AI agents. The most critical skill is no longer writing code, but designing systems and verifying behavior. Review processes must shift from code-level to behavior-level.  
* **QA Evolution:** QA becomes even more critical, moving towards systems thinking, complex integration testing, and sophisticated black-box verification to validate business logic at scale.  
* **Team Ratios:** Senior architects who own the fundamental design and can maintain a coherent vision across an AI-augmented team become exponentially more valuable. The ratio of "coders" to "architects" will likely shift.

### **C. Open Discussion**

* "Now, back to you. What shifts do you see in your teams? What part of your process would you automate first? Let's talk."
