## 🗣️ Presentation Script

### **Opening Hook (45 seconds)**
> "Here's another way I use AI that most people haven't thought of. Everyone talks about ChatGPT for emails and code. But I've built systems that completely automate professional document creation."

**Show current directory:**
```bash
ls -la
```

> "This is a multi-variant resume system. Same core experience, but I can generate completely different resumes for different types of roles. Let me show you."

### **The Traditional Resume Problem (1 minute)**
> "Here's the problem most professionals face:"

**Key Pain Points:**
- Multiple Word documents that get out of sync
- Copy/paste errors between versions
- Inconsistent formatting across applications
- Hours spent reformatting for each role type
- Version drift - which resume did I send to who?

> "I solve this with modular content and automated generation. Watch this."

### **Live Demo - Variant Generation (2-3 minutes)**

#### **Part 1: Show the Architecture**
```bash
# Show modular structure
tree content/
```

> "This is modular content architecture. Contact info, education, experience modules that get combined differently for different targets."

**Highlight key directories:**
- `content/experience/` - Individual job modules
- `content/summaries/` - Role-specific professional summaries
- `templates/` - How content gets assembled

#### **Part 2: Build First Variant**
```bash
./build-variant.sh tech-leadership
```

> "I'm building the technology leadership variant. This emphasizes team scaling, technical strategy, and organizational development."

**While it builds (10 seconds), explain:**
- Professional LaTeX typography
- Automated PDF generation
- Multiple output formats

**Show result:**
```bash
ls outputs/tech-leadership/
open outputs/tech-leadership/tech-leadership-resume.pdf
```

#### **Part 3: Build Second Variant**
```bash
./build-variant.sh ai-consultant
```

> "Now the AI consultant variant. Same core experience, but completely different emphasis - AI expertise, consulting results, technical advisory work."

**Show both PDFs side by side:**
- Same contact info and core facts
- Different professional summaries
- Different skills emphasis
- Tailored for different audiences

### **The Automation Magic (1-2 minutes)**

#### **Show Source Files**
```bash
# Show the templates
cat templates/tech-leadership.tex
```

> "Here's the magic - these templates use LaTeX's input system to combine modular content. Change one experience file, it updates across all relevant variants."

#### **Demonstrate Content Modularity**
```bash
# Show a content module
cat content/summaries/tech-leadership.tex
cat content/summaries/ai-consultant.tex
```

> "Different professional summaries for different audiences, but same underlying experience modules."

### **Business Impact & Efficiency (1 minute)**

#### **Time Savings**
> "Traditional approach: 2-3 hours per role-specific resume. My approach: 10 seconds."

#### **Quality Improvements**
- **Consistency**: Same facts across all variants
- **Professional Quality**: LaTeX typography
- **ATS Optimization**: Clean text extraction
- **Version Control**: All source files tracked in Git

#### **Scale Benefits**
> "I can maintain 5+ different resume variants. When I update a job experience, all relevant variants update automatically."

### **Technical Sophistication Demo (1 minute)**

#### **Build All Variants**
```bash
./build-all.sh
```

> "In a real job search, I build all variants at once."

**Show final output structure:**
```bash
tree outputs/
```

> "Now I have the right resume for any opportunity - startup leadership, AI consulting, enterprise roles - all generated from the same source content."
