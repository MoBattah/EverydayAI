# Commandments for this Presentation

1.  **Raise your hands!** Your contributions are more important than my content, and we *will* finish my content anyway. I will auto-manage our time.
2.  **Clarify and Correct:** In this rapidly advancing world of AI, words can have multiple meanings. If I say something that sounds wrong, needs clarification, or is out of date, please correct me. Share your stories or complimentary information. This is a place where everyone has something to contribute; there are no know-it-alls, only learn-it-alls. Our diverse audience from private equity portfolio companies means diverse experiences, which is a good thing.

## Session Guidelines & Opening Questions

- This is a discussion—jump in via chat or hand raise.
- How will the Software Development Life Cycle change when every engineer is 10x more productive but not 10x more knowledgeable?
- How is QA evolving? Are developers spending more time reading and prompting than writing code?
- Does AI change the ratio of developers to PMs or QA?

## My Essential AI Tools

This section details the key tools that power my AI workflow.

### Tool Deep Dive: Wispr Flow (Voice Dictation)

*   **Primary Use:** Voice-to-text dictation across platforms (phone, text messages, emails, AI interaction).
*   **Volume:** Dictating over 100,000 words per month, potentially nearing 200,000.
*   **Workflow:** Preferred method for interacting with AI. Dictate thoughts, AI structures them. Enables efficient message management (e.g., while walking).
*   **AI Interaction:** Voice-to-text input, text output from AI. Avoids voice-to-voice due to reduced AI content output.

---

### Tool Deep Dive: Agentic Coding

*   **Highest Abstraction:** Claude Code (pioneer, model context protocol creator)
*   **Secondary:** Gemini CLI (for tasks not consuming Claude usage, due to hitting Claude limits easily)
*   **Less Agency:** Roo (not currently relevant for your software engineering level)

---

### Tool Deep Dive: Context Storage and Management (Crucial)

*   **Method:** Massive GitHub repository storing context layers in Markdown files.
*   **Why Markdown:** AI prefers Markdown; aesthetically pleasing and integrates well with Quarto.
*   **Types of Context:** Career feelings, emotions, project goals, business insights, client/customer information, problem definitions.
*   **Avoid:** Storing context directly with foundation model providers.

### Tool Deep Dive: Other Tools

*   Willow
*   Hypernote
*   (Your own custom solution - mention its complexity for cross-platform/feature sets)

# Part 1: The New Mental Model

## Over-Index on AI – It's an Asymmetric Bet

- $20/month tools can unlock outsized ROI.
- Anecdotes:
  - Job search: ~$50 investment leading to a ~$40k salary increase.
  - $200 cloud credit enabling significant business value.

---

## Augmentation, Not Abdication

- AI augments judgment; it doesn't replace it.
- Technical due diligence: AI probes deeper, but humans make the final call.
- If a task can be automated, find the next, more valuable task.

---

# Part 2: The Practitioner's Toolkit

## The Ladder of Abstraction: From Prompting to Partnership

### Level 1: Conversational AI

- ChatGPT, Claude and similar tools as baseline assistants.

---

### Level 2: Integrated Assistants (IDE Extensions)

- Cursor, Roo, and similar VS Code extensions.
- They read codebases, propose plans, and modify code with approval.

---

### Level 3: Agentic Partners (CLI Tools)

- Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex and others.
- Operate within the terminal, execute scripts, and manage files.
- Example: organizing a downloads folder or processing `.eml` email files.

---

## Workflow: Knowledge Pipeline (Quarto & LaTeX)

- Write in Markdown; render beautiful PDFs.
- Reuse templates for SOWs, reports, and a flexible resume system.

---

## Workflow: Information Edge

- Export LinkedIn data and query it far beyond the UI.
- "Deep research" prompts create rich briefings for meetings.

---

## Workflow: Personal Augment (Vocabulary Builder)

- Inspired by *Word Power Made Easy*.
- Feed transcripts or documents to learn new words at the edge of your vocabulary.

---

## AI in Action: Folder Structure

---

# Part 3: The Broader Implications

## AI as a Deflationary Force

- Skydio drones inspecting power lines.
- Gecko Robotics monitoring infrastructure.
- Improved efficiency in the physical world lowers costs for everyone.

---

## Beware of "Vibe Coding"

- Productivity isn't a substitute for foundational systems knowledge.
- Example: choosing NoSQL when a relational database is required.
