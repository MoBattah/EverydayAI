# Commandments for this Presentation

1.  **Raise your hands!** Your contributions are more important than my content, and we *will* finish my content anyway. I will auto-manage our time.
2.  **Clarify and Correct:** In this rapidly advancing world of AI, words can have multiple meanings. If I say something that sounds wrong, needs clarification, or is out of date, please correct me. Share your stories or complimentary information. This is a place where everyone has something to contribute; there are no know-it-alls, only learn-it-alls. Our diverse audience from private equity portfolio companies means diverse experiences, which is a good thing.

## My Essential AI Tools

This section details the key tools that power my AI workflow.

## Tool Deep Dive: Wispr Flow (Voice Dictation)

*   **Primary Use:** Voice-to-text dictation across platforms (phone, text messages, emails, AI interaction).
*   **Volume:** Dictating over 100,000 words per month, potentially nearing 200,000.
*   **Workflow:** Preferred method for interacting with AI. Dictate thoughts, AI structures them. Enables efficient message management (e.g., while walking).
*   **AI Interaction:** Voice-to-text input, text output from AI. Avoids voice-to-voice due to reduced AI content output.

## Tool Deep Dive: Agentic Coding

*   **Highest Abstraction:** Claude Code (pioneer, model context protocol creator)
*   **Secondary:** Gemini CLI (for tasks not consuming Claude usage, due to hitting Claude limits easily)
*   **Less Agency:** Roo (not currently relevant for your software engineering level)

## Tool Deep Dive: Context Storage and Management (Crucial)

*   **Method:** Massive GitHub repository storing context layers in Markdown files.
*   **Why Markdown:** AI prefers Markdown; aesthetically pleasing and integrates well with Quarto.
*   **Types of Context:** Career feelings, emotions, project goals, business insights, client/customer information, problem definitions.
*   **Avoid:** Storing context directly with foundation model providers.

## Tool Deep Dive: Other Tools

*   Willow
*   Hypernote
*   (Your own custom solution - mention its complexity for cross-platform/feature sets)
