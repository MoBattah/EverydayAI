# Prompts

This repository serves as a curated collection of advanced prompts designed to guide large language models (LLMs) in performing specialized tasks. The prompts are meticulously crafted to provide clear instructions, define personas, outline methodologies, and specify output formats, enabling LLMs to deliver high-quality, structured, and contextually relevant responses.

## Structure

The prompts are organized into categories based on their domain or application:

- `linguistics-prompts/`: Contains prompts focused on linguistic analysis, document improvement, vocabulary coaching, and other language-related tasks.
- `osint/`: Contains prompts related to Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) gathering, due diligence investigations, and reputation research using publicly available information.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to:

- **Showcase advanced prompt engineering:** Demonstrate how detailed and structured prompts can unlock sophisticated capabilities in LLMs.
- **Provide reusable templates:** Offer ready-to-use prompts for common and specialized AI-assisted tasks.
- **Facilitate collaboration:** Serve as a platform for sharing and refining effective prompts.

## Usage

To use a prompt, simply copy its content and provide it to a compatible large language model. Remember to fill in any bracketed placeholders (e.g., `[Full Name of Individual]`) with your specific information.

## Contributing

Contributions of new, well-structured, and effective prompts are welcome. Please ensure that any new prompts adhere to the existing organizational structure and maintain a high level of detail and clarity.
