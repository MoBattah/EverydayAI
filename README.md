# AI Tools in Practice: Demos, Workflows, and Personal Methods

This repository serves as an **open-source collection of practical demonstrations, automated workflows, and personal methodologies** for effectively integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools into everyday work and life. It showcases how AI can be leveraged to enhance productivity, automate complex tasks, and achieve professional-grade outputs across various domains.

## Purpose and Philosophy

The core philosophy behind this collection is to move beyond theoretical understanding of AI to practical application. It emphasizes a structured, reproducible, and efficient approach to using AI, particularly when combined with robust document generation tools and advanced prompt engineering techniques. This repository aims to share actionable examples that others can explore, adapt, and extend.

## Repository Structure and Contents

This collection is organized into two primary sections: `demos` and `prompts`, each containing specialized examples.

### `demos/`

This directory contains practical demonstrations of AI-assisted document generation and automation, primarily utilizing Quarto and LaTeX for high-quality output.

*   **`demos/latex-quarto/alpine-ai/`**: A comprehensive set of examples demonstrating professional document creation with AI, Quarto, and LaTeX.
    *   **`presentation/`**: Examples of creating dynamic, AI-assisted presentations using Quarto and Reveal.js.
    *   **`report-generation/`**: Demonstrations of generating professional technical reports and documents with AI-assisted content, custom branding, and automated PDF output via Quarto and XeLaTeX.
    *   **`resume-system/`**: A multi-variant resume generation system showcasing modular content management, automated build processes, and professional output formats (PDF, text) for different career profiles.

### `prompts/`

This directory houses a collection of meticulously crafted AI prompts designed for specific, advanced tasks, illustrating the power of detailed prompt engineering.

*   **`linguistics-prompts/`**: Contains specialized prompts, such as the "Heehler Method Vocabulary Coach," designed to enhance writing quality, rhetorical precision, and vocabulary through AI-guided linguistic analysis.
*   **`osint/`**: Includes detailed prompts for Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) tasks, like "Individual Reputation Research," outlining structured approaches for conducting comprehensive background investigations using publicly available information.

## Types of Examples Included

The materials in this repository encompass a variety of formats and applications:

*   **Quarto Notebooks (`.qmd`)**: For reproducible research, dynamic reports, and interactive presentations.
*   **LaTeX Templates (`.tex`)**: For professional typography, custom document layouts, and high-quality PDF generation.
*   **Shell Scripts (`.sh`)**: For automating build processes, content compilation, and workflow orchestration.
*   **Markdown Files (`.md`)**: For detailed prompt engineering examples, documentation, and instructional content.
*   **HTML Exports**: Generated from Quarto projects for web-based viewing of presentations and reports.
*   **PDF Outputs**: Final, professionally formatted documents generated from Quarto and LaTeX sources.

## How to Use and Extend These Materials

This repository is designed for exploration and adaptation:

1.  **Browse**: Navigate through the directories to understand the different types of AI applications and workflows.
2.  **Learn**: Examine the `.md` and `.qmd` files to understand the prompt engineering techniques and document structures.
3.  **Replicate**: Follow the `build.sh` or `build-variant.sh` scripts within the `demos` to reproduce the outputs.
4.  **Adapt**: Modify the prompts, content modules, or Quarto/LaTeX configurations to suit your own projects and needs.
5.  **Contribute**: Feel free to fork the repository, experiment, and contribute your own AI-enhanced workflows or prompt examples.

## Tools and Platforms Credited

This collection extensively utilizes and demonstrates the capabilities of:

*   **Quarto**: An open-source publishing system for creating dynamic and reproducible documents.
*   **LaTeX / XeLaTeX**: A high-quality typesetting system for professional document preparation.
*   **Various AI Models/Tools**: The underlying large language models (LLMs) and AI platforms that power the prompt engineering examples and content generation.
